# Implementing data quality checks with Tinybird

This repository includes a simple data project to test for 5 criteria of data quality on the [NYC Taxi dataset](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) and publish the results of the tests as an API endpoint that you can use in CI/CD pipelines for data QA.

## Clone the repo
First, clone the repo into a directory of your choice with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinybirdco/data-quality-checks.git
cd data-quality-checks
```

### Set up your .gitignore
Tinybird stores your auth details in a `.tinyb` file. Add this to your `.gitignore` if you intend to push your work to GitHub.

## Setting up Tinybird
If you want to follow along with the examples, go ahead and [sign up](https://www.tinybird.co/signup) for a free Tinybird account and create a Workspace.

Once you've done that, copy your user admin token in the Tinybird UI. It's the token that says `Use it to authenticate with the CLI.`.

### Set up your local environment
The easiest way to install the Tinybird CLI is with pip using a Python virtual environment. Run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install tinybird-cli
```

Then go ahead and set your token as an environment variable for auth:

```bash
export TB_TOKEN=<paste your token here>
```

Authenticate to your Tinybird Workspace with:

```bash
tb auth
```

## Pushing your project to the server
Now you can push the data project files from the repo to the Tinybird server. 

## Create the Data Source
Start by pushing the Data Source with

```bash
tb push datasources/yellow_tripdata.datasource
```

This creates an empty Data Source server side with the correct schema.

### Adding data to the Data Source
Next, add data to the Data Source with

```bash
tb datasource append yellow_tripdata https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2023-03.parquet
```

**Note**: You might find that some rows go to quarantine. As weâ€™ll see, this can be due to data quality issues in the source data! To learn more about data quarantine in Tinybird, [go here](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/concepts/data-sources.html#the-quarantine-data-source). In the meantime, you can ignore this for the sake of following along.

### Push the Pipe
In the `/endpoints` folder is a `.pipe` file. You can push this to the Tinybird server with 

```bash
tb push endpoints/yellow_trip_data_qa_measurements.pipe
```

By default, Tinybird publishes the last node of the Pipe as an API endpoint when you push with the CLI.

### Generate a read token for the Pipe
To create a token to read the API, you'll need to navigate to the Tinybird UI: [https://ui.tinybird.co](https://ui.tinybird.co) for EU or [https://ui.us-east.tinybird.co](https://ui.us-east.tinybird.co) for US-East.

Click "Auth Tokens", then "Add a new token", then "Add Pipe scope", choose `yellow_trip_data_qa_measurements` and give it a `Read` scope.

Copy this token.

## Call your API

You can now call your API and get a JSON result with the following cURL:

```bash
curl --compressed -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>'  https://api.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/yellow_trip_data_qa_measurements.json
```

**Note**: For workspaces in US-EAST, use `https://api.us-east.tinybird.co...`

If you navigate back to the Tinybird UI, you can find additional sample usage for the endpoint on the API page.
